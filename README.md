# Star-Category-Classification

Project Title: Star Category Classification

The "Star Category Classification" project is a comprehensive machine learning endeavour designed to classify stars based on a range of features, including temperature, luminosity, radius, absolute magnitude, star type, star colour, and spectral class. The project's objective is to predict the spectral class of a star, which includes categories such as Red Dwarf, Brown Dwarf, White Dwarf, Main Sequence, SuperGiants, and HyperGiants.

The project follows a structured lifecycle, starting with data collection and preprocessing. The dataset, containing information about various stars, undergoes cleaning and transformation to ensure its suitability for analysis. Exploratory data analysis is then performed using statistical methods to gain insights into the distribution and relationships between different features. The Seaborn and Matplotlib libraries are utilized for visualization, aiding in the interpretation of data patterns and trends.

Feature engineering is conducted to optimize the dataset for model training. The logistic algorithm, chosen for its effectiveness in classification tasks, is employed for the machine learning model. The dataset is split into training and testing sets, and the model is trained on the former. Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are employed to assess the model's performance.

The project's findings are communicated through visualizations, highlighting the relationships between features and the predictive capabilities of the model. The deployment of the logistic algorithm in classifying star categories enhances our understanding of the factors influencing the spectral class of stars.

In summary, the "Star Category Classification" project encapsulates the entire project lifecycle â€“ from data collection and preprocessing to exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation. Through the use of statistical methods, visualization libraries, and a logistic classification algorithm, the project contributes valuable insights into the classification of stars based on essential astronomical features.
